# America Ditched the Can

A quick-and-dirty class exercise where I reimagined this [Chart of Note](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/charts-of-note/chart-detail?chartId=113353) about the shift in U.S. pineapple consumption from processed (canned and juice) to fresh over the past three decades.

## Methods

A frontend design Claude Skill was used to render the chart, which is built with D3 and Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

## Data Source

USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, and Bureau of the Census
